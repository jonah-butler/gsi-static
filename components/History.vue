        Greensboro sit-in, act of nonviolent protest against a segregated lunch
        counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, that began on February 1, 1960.
        Its success led to a wider sit-in movement, organized primarily by the
        Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), that spread throughout
        the South.

        The sit-in was organized by Ezell Blair, Jr. (later Jibreel Khazan), Franklin McCain,
        Joseph McNeil, and David Richmondâ€”all African Americans and all students at North Carolina
        Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro. Influenced by the nonviolent protest
        techniques of Mohandas Gandhi and the Journey of Reconciliation (an antecedent of the Freedom Rides)
        organized by the Congress of Racial Equality, the four men executed a plan to draw attention to racial
        segregation in the private sector. Enlisting the aid of Ralph Johns, a local white businessman who was
        sympathetic to their cause, the students, who came to be dubbed the Greensboro Four, planned their social
        action in great detail.
